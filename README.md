Simple client-side static page to convert any file to ASCII text (a-z) / (English words) for transport. 

Possible use cases are sending files over channels where only text is permitted / reliable. Or sending / archiving binary files
as print outs that can be typed back in (given enough time / will to do so).

Size expands about 8x (but depends), may as well zip first.
